# Serializable transaction protocol

- **Task:** TASK-0009 (STORY-0005; feeds TASK-0010, TASK-0011, TASK-0012, TASK-0020)
- **Status:** Draft — pending review
- **Satisfies:** REQ-0014, REQ-0028, REQ-0015, REQ-0005, REQ-0010 (both edge entries atomically)
- **Bound by:** DEC-0002 (Raft per range), DEC-0003 (serializable by default), DEC-0004 (eventually consistent analytics), DEC-0006 (DETACH DELETE in one transaction)
- **Proposed decision:** a Raft-replicated timestamp oracle (TSO). See §3 and the DEC recorded as *proposed* in reqforge.

> **Verification note.** Written without web access. Claims about CockroachDB, TiDB,
> Percolator, FoundationDB and Jepsen results come from background knowledge and are
> marked **[verify]**. The correctness argument in §6 depends only on this document.

## 1. Requirements in one table

| Need | Source | Eval |
|---|---|---|
| Every transaction is serializable; no knob lowers isolation | REQ-0014 AC1 | STORY-0005 E1 `isolation_locked` |
| 0 anomalies under partitions, crashes, **clock skew**, membership changes and splits, 1 h per release | REQ-0014 AC2 | STORY-0005 E2 (Elle, list-append) |
| A multi-shard write is all-or-nothing when the coordinator crashes at any phase | REQ-0028 AC1 | STORY-0005 E3 `coordinator_crash_atomic` |
| No silent retry once the read set has changed | REQ-0015 | STORY-0006 |
| A distinct, retryable `SERIALIZATION_CONFLICT` code, used only for conflicts | REQ-0005 | STORY-0006 |

## 2. Summary of the design

- **Timestamps:** a TSO hands out strictly increasing 64-bit timestamps. Its state lives in the meta range, and allocation is batched.
- **Storage:** multi-version (MVCC) on the ordered keyspace. Writes first land as **intents**, which are provisional writes owned by a transaction.
- **Commit:** Percolator-style two-phase commit. Each transaction has a **transaction record** on its *anchor* (primary) key. Commit is a single Raft write of that record. Secondary intents are resolved asynchronously.
- **Serializability:** **commit-time read validation**. The transaction reads at `start_ts`, gets `commit_ts`, then checks that nothing it read changed in `(start_ts, commit_ts]`. If something did, it aborts with `SERIALIZATION_CONFLICT`.
- **Single range:** a transaction confined to one range commits in two Raft entries: prewrite, then `CommitLocal` (§5).

## 3. Timestamp source: TSO vs HLC

| | **TSO** (TiDB Placement Driver / Percolator style **[verify]**) | **HLC + uncertainty** (CockroachDB style **[verify]**) |
|---|---|---|
| How timestamps are made | A single Raft-replicated allocator; strictly monotonic | Each node's hybrid logical clock; ordering relies on max clock offset |
| Dependence on clock sync | **None for correctness**. Clocks only drive lease timing | Reads within the uncertainty window restart. Correctness relies on the bound, so nodes must self-terminate when it is exceeded **[verify]** |
| Guarantee reached with read validation | Strict serializability (commit order matches real time) | Serializable; real-time ordering is only within the clock bound **[verify]** |
| Latency cost | One TSO round trip at begin and at commit. Same AZ: sub-millisecond; cross-AZ: ~1–2 ms; batching amortises it | No extra round trip; uncertainty restarts appear under skew |
| Failure mode | TSO leader failover pauses allocation for every transaction (cluster-wide blip ≤ election timeout) | No single component; skew beyond the bound becomes an **anomaly risk** |
| Under REQ-0014's clock nemesis | Skew affects leases, not ordering. Expected anomalies: 0 | Depends on self-termination and the offset bound holding during the nemesis |
| Multi-region | Poor: every transaction crosses to the TSO's region | Good |

**Recommendation: TSO.** Three reasons:
- **The clock nemesis is a release gate.** REQ-0014 AC2 runs Elle with clock skew on
  every release. A TSO takes clock skew out of the correctness argument altogether, so
  the nemesis can only cause availability problems, not anomalies.
- **v1 is one region.** The AZ-level placement in REQ-0001 makes the TSO round trip a
  same-region cost. It can be batched: one RPC hands out a block of timestamps to many
  waiting transactions.
- **It's the simpler correctness argument (§6),** and that argument is what the Jepsen
  suite will test.

**Revisit if** multi-region writes become a requirement. Moving to HLC would then mean
replacing the timestamp provider and adding uncertainty-interval reads. MVCC, intents
and the commit protocol carry over unchanged.

**TSO design:**
- It runs on the meta-range leaseholder.
- It persists a high-water mark `max_ts` through Raft in steps of, for example, 3 s
  worth of logical time.
- It serves timestamps from memory below `max_ts`.
- A new leader resumes at the persisted `max_ts`, which is strictly above anything
  already served, so timestamps never repeat or go backwards across failover.
- Timestamp layout: physical milliseconds (46 bits) followed by a logical counter
  (18 bits).

## 4. MVCC layout

The keys below follow the encodings in `raft-ranges.md` §9.

```
{user_key} 0x00 {!commit_ts:u64}    committed version (ts bit-inverted → newest first)
{user_key} 0x00 0x00…00             intent slot (sorts before every version) → IntentMeta
{anchor_key} 0x01 'txn' {txn_id}    transaction record (on the anchor key's range)
```

- **IntentMeta** is `{ txn_id, start_ts, anchor_key, value | tombstone }`. A key has at most one intent at a time.
- **Reading at ts `t`:** seek to `{user_key} 0x00`. If an intent is there and belongs to
  another transaction, follow §7. Otherwise return the first version with
  `commit_ts ≤ t`.
- **Garbage collection:** versions older than `gc_ttl` (default 4 h; must cover the
  longest read and the PITR granularity in REQ-0019) are removed by a compaction filter.
  The newest version at or below the GC threshold is always kept.

## 5. Commit protocol

**Begin.** `start_ts ← TSO`. The client-side coordinator, inside the gateway node,
keeps the read set and the write buffer.

**Reads.** Read at `start_ts`. Record each **read span** in the read set: a point key
or a scanned range `[a, b)`, for example the adjacency prefix of a one-hop traversal.

**Writes.** Buffer them in the coordinator. The first written key becomes the **anchor**.

**Commit.**

1. **Prewrite.** For each written key, write an intent through Raft on that key's
   range. Prewrite fails with `SERIALIZATION_CONFLICT` if the key has a committed
   version with `commit_ts > start_ts` (write-write conflict) or another transaction's
   live intent. Live means its record is PENDING with a fresh heartbeat; §7 says how
   to push it.
   The **transaction record** `{status: PENDING, heartbeat_ts, start_ts}` is written
   together with the anchor's intent in the same Raft entry.
2. **Get `commit_ts ← TSO`.** This happens strictly after every intent from step 1 is
   durable.
3. **Validate the read set.** For each read span, the span's range leaseholder checks
   for a committed version with `start_ts < commit_ts' ≤ commit_ts`, or for another
   transaction's intent whose record isn't ABORTED (§7). Either one aborts with
   `SERIALIZATION_CONFLICT`. Validation of point keys and scanned spans runs in
   parallel across ranges. Spans the transaction also wrote are skipped.
4. **Commit point.** A conditional Raft write on the anchor's range sets the record
   from PENDING to `COMMITTED{commit_ts}`. **This single write decides the transaction.**
   Once it's applied, the client is acknowledged.
5. **Resolve.** Asynchronously, turn each intent into a committed version at
   `commit_ts`, then garbage-collect the record.

**Single range (two entries).** When every write and every read span is in one range:
1. Prewrite the intents together with the record (one entry).
2. Take `commit_ts`.
3. A single `CommitLocal` entry validates the reads, checks the record is still PENDING,
   marks it COMMITTED and turns the intents into versions.

*Why not one entry (corrected 2026-10-07):* the draft took `commit_ts` first and wrote
versions in one entry with no intents. That breaks the §6.1 invariant, which needs
intents durable before `commit_ts`:
- Writer W takes `commit_ts = c`. Its entry is not yet applied.
- Reader R starts at `s > c`. It sees neither W's version nor an intent, so it reads the
  old value.
- R commits. W's version at `c < s` is outside R's validation window, so R overwrites W.

`dscore-harness jepsen --workload register` caught this as lost updates: about 10% of
70k contended increments. With two entries it records 0 violations.

**Read-only transactions** read at `start_ts` and commit without validation (§6.2).

**Edges.** An edge insert writes `n/{src}/o/…` and `n/{dst}/i/…` (REQ-0010). These
usually sit in two ranges, so the transaction takes the 2PC path. Both entries become
visible at the same `commit_ts` because readers resolve intents through the anchor
record, so no reader sees a one-sided edge (REQ-0010 AC2).

## 6. Why this is serializable

Serialization order is `commit_ts`; read-only transactions are ordered by `start_ts`.

### 6.1 Read-write transactions

Take a read-write transaction T with `start_ts = s` and `commit_ts = c`. T's reads
observe the state at `s`. It is enough to show that no transaction U with
`s < u = commit_ts(U) < c` wrote into T's read set. If no such U exists, the state at
`s` equals the state just before `c` on every span T read, so T is equivalent to
executing atomically at `c`.

- **Case 1: U's commit point applied before T's validation read the span.** Then
  validation (step 3) sees U's committed version in `(s, c]`, or U's intent pointing to
  a COMMITTED record. T aborts.
- **Case 2: U's commit point had not applied when T validated.** U obtained
  `u < c` from the TSO before T obtained `c`. Because the TSO is strictly monotonic,
  U's step 2 happened before T's step 2. U's step 2 follows completion of U's
  prewrites (U's step 1). So U's intents on every key U writes were durable before
  T's step 2, and therefore before T's validation. T's validation finds U's intent,
  whose record is PENDING or COMMITTED, so T aborts. T may push U first (§7), but it
  never ignores the intent.

Writes between `c` and T's own commit point don't matter: they are ordered after T.
Write-write conflicts are caught at prewrite. **This argument doesn't mention
wall-clock time anywhere**, which is why REQ-0014's clock nemesis can't create
anomalies (§3).

**Phantoms.** A read span is a key range, not a key set. An insert of a new key inside
`[a, b)` with `commit_ts ∈ (s, c]` is a committed version, or an intent, inside the
span, so validation catches it.

### 6.2 Read-only transactions

They read at `s` and must see every transaction with `commit_ts ≤ s`, all of it or
none of it.

- A writer U with `u < s` got `u` from the TSO before the reader got `s`, so U's
  intents were durable before the read began (prewrite precedes step 2).
- U may not have reached its commit point yet. The reader still meets U's intent and
  must **wait or push** (§7), never skip it.
- Once U's record is decided, the reader sees all of U at `u` (COMMITTED) or none of
  it (ABORTED).

That makes every read a consistent snapshot at `s`.

## 7. Conflicts, pushes and coordinator recovery (REQ-0028)

**When a reader or writer meets another transaction's intent,** it looks up the
intent's transaction record at the anchor:

| Record | Action |
|---|---|
| `COMMITTED{c}` | Resolve the intent to a version at `c`, then continue |
| `ABORTED` or missing (and past the creation grace period) | Remove the intent, then continue |
| `PENDING`, heartbeat fresh | Wait up to `lock_wait_timeout`, then retry. A writer gives up with `SERIALIZATION_CONFLICT`. Deadlocks are broken by a wait-for graph on the anchor leaseholders, or v1 settles for timeout plus abort (open question Q3) |
| `PENDING`, heartbeat older than `txn_liveness_ttl` (default 5 s) | **Push to abort.** A conditional Raft write PENDING → ABORTED on the anchor. That write races with the coordinator's own commit; exactly one wins |

**Coordinator crash at each phase (REQ-0028 AC1, E3):**

| Crash point | State left | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Before or during prewrite | Some intents and possibly a PENDING record | Heartbeat expires and it is pushed to ABORTED: **none visible** |
| After prewrite, before validation | All intents and a PENDING record | Same: **none visible** |
| After validation, before commit point | Same | Same: **none visible** |
| After commit point, before resolve | COMMITTED record and intents | Readers resolve forward: **all visible** |
| During resolve | Mix of versions and intents | Intents still point at COMMITTED: **all visible** |

The decision is the single anchor-record write in every case, so the outcome is always
all or none. E3 injects a crash at each row, 100 trials.

**Liveness.** The coordinator heartbeats the record every `txn_liveness_ttl / 3`.
Long-running transactions stay alive; transactions on a crashed gateway are aborted
within one TTL.

## 8. Retry and error contract (REQ-0005, REQ-0015)

- **Error code.** `SERIALIZATION_CONFLICT` is returned only for: a write-write conflict
  at prewrite, failed read validation, being pushed to ABORTED, or lock-wait timeout.
  Syntax, permission and constraint errors have their own codes (REQ-0005 AC2). Unique
  index violations (REQ-0031 AC2) are constraint errors, not conflicts.
- **Internal retry** (TASK-0011) is allowed **only** when no result row has been
  returned to the client and the transaction is a single auto-commit statement. The
  server then re-runs the whole statement at a fresh `start_ts`. In an interactive
  multi-statement transaction, the client has already seen reads, so the server never
  retries and returns `SERIALIZATION_CONFLICT` (REQ-0015 AC1).
- **Read refresh, which skips the retry entirely.** If validation fails only because
  `start_ts` is too old, but the values read are unchanged in `(s, c]`, there is no
  conflict, since validation compares versions, not timestamps. This is already the
  §5 step 3 rule.
- **Isolation is fixed.** The protocol accepts no isolation setting. Any session or
  client attempt to set a lower level returns a configuration error (REQ-0014 AC1,
  E1 `isolation_locked`).

## 9. Interaction with other subsystems

- **Raft leases:** intents, records and validation go through the range leaseholder.
  A lease transfer carries the range latch state. The TSO's monotonicity doesn't depend
  on leases.
- **Splits:** a span validated across a split boundary is re-routed per range. A stale
  routing attempt gets `RangeMismatch` and retries the *validation step*, not the
  transaction.
- **Analytics learners (DEC-0004):**
  - They apply the same Raft log, so they hold intents too.
  - They serve reads at a **resolved timestamp**: the highest ts below which every
    intent in the range is resolved, published by the leader.
  - Those reads are eventually consistent and need no validation, which REQ-0025..27
    allows.
- **Indexes (REQ-0031):** index entries are ordinary keys written in the same
  transaction. They get intents and validation like data keys, so reads through an
  index are serializable.

## 10. How the harness verifies it

- **E2:** Elle list-append for 1 h with the nemeses `partition, crash, clock,
  membership, split`. It checks serializable (G0, G1a/b/c, G-single, G2).
  Plan: also run with `--check strict-serializable` to confirm the TSO's stronger
  guarantee **[verify Elle flag name]**.
- **E3:** a crash-injection point at each row of the §7 table.
- **Extra edge test:** concurrent edge insert, update and delete across shards. A
  checker reads both endpoints at one snapshot and asserts 0 one-sided edges
  (REQ-0010 AC2).

## 11. Open questions for the reviewer

1. **Q1.** Accept **TSO** over HLC for v1 (proposed DEC)? It knowingly gives up cheap
   multi-region writes.
2. **Q2.** Defaults: TSO batch window, `txn_liveness_ttl` (5 s), `lock_wait_timeout`
   (proposed 1 s) and `gc_ttl` (4 h).
3. **Q3.** Deadlock handling in v1: timeout plus abort (proposed), or wait-for-graph
   detection?
4. **Q4.** Parallel commits (CockroachDB-style: commit without waiting on a separate
   record write **[verify]**). Defer to after v1? It saves one Raft round trip on the
   commit path of multi-range transactions.
5. **Q5.** Read-set size cap: above N spans or M bytes, collapse spans to coarser
   ranges (more false conflicts), or reject the transaction?
